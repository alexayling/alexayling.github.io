I am a Ph.D. candidate at the California Institute of Technology, and I am advised by Professor Ali Hajimiri. My research focuses on high-speed analog IC design, mm-wave and microwave RFIC design, phased arrays, and wireless systems. I have led multiple successful chip tape-outs in 22 nm CMOS FDSOI, 28nm CMOS, 65nm CMOS, and 130nm SiGe BiCMOS, and have experience designing and testing integrated circuits blocks such as phase shifters, frequency multipliers, mixers, amplifiers, power amplifiers, high-speed LO distribution, high-speed ESD protection, biasing, and custom digital blocks.

My research has contributed to space-based solar power capabilities, including the first demonstration of wireless power transmission in space: (<a href="https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/in-a-first-caltechs-space-solar-power-demonstrator-wirelessly-transmits-power-in-space" target="_blank">Caltech News Release</a>). Prior to Caltech, I completed a Masters in Electrical Engineering from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign working with Professor Elyse Rosenbaum on ESD Integrated Circuit Reliability. I received a Bachelors degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Minnesota, Twin-Cities in 2018. I was a High-Speed/mm-Wave ASIC Research intern at <a href="https://www.nokia.com" target="_blank">Nokia Bell Labs</a> in 2025 and an ESD Reliability Research intern at <a href="https://www.analog.com/en/index.html" target="_blank">Analog Devices Inc</a> in 2019.
